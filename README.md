"# WW-Fitbit-Sync" 

Weight Watcher sync to Fitbit!

The purpose of this app is to grab food logs from the weight
watchers website and add the food items to a fitbit API. This is
by scraping the Weight watchers website using python, and
must scrape past a login screen.

As of python 3.4, pip is bundled inside this verion making it 
super easy to include packages with the command 
"py -m pip install [desired package]"
