Weight Watchers Fitbit Sync

The purpose of this app is to grab food logs from the Weight
Watchers website and add food items to a fitbit API. This is done
by scraping the Weight watchers website using python and
scraping past a log screen.

As of python 3.4, pip is bundled inside this verion making it 
super easy to include packages with the command 
"py -m pip install [desired package]"
